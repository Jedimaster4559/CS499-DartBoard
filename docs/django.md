# Django Backend
Our application is based off a Django Backend. This allows us to write data migrations and not have to worry as much
about the portability of the database systems used by our application.

# Notes:
- There is a file `dartboard/manage.py`. This file is used for calling django commands from the command line. Please
do not edit this file.
- Updates to the datamodel will require new migrations to be generated. Call
`python manage.py makemigrations backend`
